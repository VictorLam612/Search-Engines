# Search-Engines
This class was centered around information retrieval (IR), the basis for building any search engine. We learn about how search engines process queries, digital media, perform IR, and how to evaluate the performance of the search engine. IR is focused on returning to the user documents that are relevant to their query, and we can give relevancy scores to these files that allow for IR technique evaluation.
